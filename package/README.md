### Setup

Thank you for your interest in this exciting project! Redux Chess is "just a chessboard" as lightweight as it can possibly be. It requires this [chess server](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server) up and running as well as this [chess API](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-api).

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Chess } from '@tahdiislam/update-chess';

const props = {
  api: {
    prot: 'https',
    host: 'pchess.net',
    port: '443'
  },
  server: {
    prot: 'wss',
    host: 'pchess.net',
    port: '8443'
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Chess props={props} />,
  document.getElementById('redux-chess')
);
```

Redux Chess sends messages to a WebSocket server. Make sure the WebSocket server is running on localhost as described next.
